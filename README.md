### Bike Usage by hour of Day : 

Investigating bike usage by hour of day could be useful in determining several criteria in support of the CitiBikes system.  For example - are there enough bikes to meet the demand at the right bike stations? Are there enough stations to dock the bikes? To analyze this, I took a look at all trips recoded in 2018, and separated the data into 2 groups - trips taken on weekdays and trips taken on weekends.

The Trend - An interesting phenomena appeared. The weekday plot shows a predictable trend - peak times are clearly between 8 & 9 am in the mornings, and 5 & 6 pm in the evenings - corresponding closely with workday commute times. 

Over the weekends, a different trend emerges - a more gradual  increase until mid afternoon followed by a gradual decline as the evening progresses.  The data plotted is for the entire year, but average trips per month, or week could easily be calculated.

### Bike trips and usage trends year over year.

Plotting and analyzing a comparison of the number of weekly trips taken in 2018 and comparing it to data from 2020 revealed a sharp reduction of trips 2020 starting around the 11th week of 2020 - this is in constrast to the 2018 line where at at the same time, when the weather is starting to get warmer, bike usage typically increases - this must be attributed to lockdowns that were implemented to stem the spread of the coronavirus.  There is a continuing trend upwards in 2020 to a point where 2020 weekly bike trips surpasses 2018, but then for both years, there is a rapid decline around week 44 - as winter weather sets in.

Further analysis of the approximately 1000 bikes was done to determine the total duration of all trips for each bike.  Bike usage in 2018 was approximately 3X higher that it has been in 2020, again most like due to the impact of the Coronavirus. These plots can also be used to quickly identify which bikes are most in need of service. 

### The Map of CitiBike Stations and their popularity.

**There were 2,248,869 trips taken in October 2020 from all bikes in the Citibike system.**

**Year to date 2020, there were 16,681,224 trips taken.**

A map of all bike station active as of the most recent data available (October 2020) revealed a couple interesting trends. First, the majority of bike stations in Menhattan have trip activity that range between 2000 and 6000 trips per month, there are a surprising mumber od stations that have trip activity in the 7000 to 10000 range, with 6 stations exceeding 10000 trips/month.  Areas surrpounding Manhattan have significantly lower usage, which as as would be expected given the lower population density.
